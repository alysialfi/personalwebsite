              <p className="helo_desc justify-content-left">I'm Alfi, 19 years old girl who lives in Malang. 3 years of studying in a vocational school, made me familiar with software development especially web and mobile application, also based on previous work experience in which I was involved in massive projects also strengthen my understanding of software development. In terms of job desk, I was often charged with web or app front-end task, this is why I encouraged to study more about front-end.
I am sociable and love enjoys traveling, going somewhere I've never been before then met new people with their stories is sort of holy grail to refresh my mind. Taking a look at what is trending is also interesting so that keep me updated and understand what are people talking about.
